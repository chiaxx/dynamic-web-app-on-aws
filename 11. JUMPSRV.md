# SSH into an EC2 Instance in the Private Subnet

To SSH into the instances in the private subnet
- First, we will launch an EC2 instance in the public subnet
- Next, we will SSH in the instance we launched in the public subnets
- Then from the instance in the public subnet, we can SSH into any instance in the private subnets.
  
1. BASTION HOST
EC2 > Instance > Launch an instance 
- name[bastionHost] 
- ami [amazon-linux-2] 
- instance type [t2.micro] 
- keypair [new/existing] 
- network setting [edit]:
   - select vpc[dev-vpc]
   - subnet [public subnet AZ1]
   - select SG [ssh-SG] ->
- Storage [default] 
- Review and Launch [Launch]


2. ssh to private server
   - ssh ec2-user@<privateIPaddress> -> yes

4. USING ENDPOINTS INSTEAD OF BASTION HOST/ JUMP SERVERS
