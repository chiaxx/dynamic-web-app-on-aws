# Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

Once we have installed and configured our website, we will use the EC2 instance we installed our website on to create an AMI. Then we can use the AMI to launch new EC2 instances with our website already configured on them.

EC2 > Select the [Setup Server] > Actions > Image and templates > Create Image
- name: fleetcart ami
- description: fleetcart ami
- Tags > Select [Tag image and snapshots together]
- add tag:Name | fleetcart ami
- Create Image

# OR
