Create Nat Gateways in AWS

The NAT Gateway allows the instances in the private app subnets and private data subnets to access the internet
The Private Route table is associated with the private subnets and routes traffic to the internet through the nat gateway 

create NAT Gateway
- VPC -> NAT Gateway -> Create NAT Gateway [nat gw AZ1]-> subnet[public subnet az1]-> allocate elastic ip -> create nat gateway

create a route table 
- route table -> create rt -> name [private rt AZ1] ->  select vpc [dev-vpc] ->create rt

Add a route to the rt to route traffic to the internet through the nat gateway in the public subnets
routes -> edit routes -> add routes-> des[0.0.0.0/0] -> target[nat gw AZ1]

associate the rt wth subnet
subnet association -> edit sub association -> select [private app/data subnet AZ1] -> save association
 
=========================================================================================================

create the second nat Gateway
nat gateway -> create [nat gw AZ2] -> subnet[public subnet AZ2] -> allocate elastic ip -> create nat gateway

create a second route table 
- route table -> create rt -> name [private rt AZ2] -> select vpc [dev-vpc] -> create rt

Add a route to the rt to route traffic to the internet through the nat gateway in the public subnet AZ2
routes -> edit routes -> add routes-> des[0.0.0.0/0] -> target[nat gw AZ2]

associate the rt wth subnet[private app/data subnet AZ2]
subnet association -> edit sub association -> select [private app/data subnet AZ2] -> save association
