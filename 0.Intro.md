# Deploying a Dynamic Website on AWS

1. VPC with public and private subnets in 2 AZs. 

2. An IGW is used to allow communication b/w instances in VPC and the internet

3. We are using 2 AZs for high availabilty and fault tolerance.

4. Resources such as NAT gateway, Bastion host, and application load balancer uses Public Subnets.

5. We will put the webservers and database servers in the private subnets to protect them.

6. The NAT gateway allows the instances in the private app subnets and private data subnets to access the internet

7. We are using an MYSQL RDS database.

8. We are using EC2 instances to host our website.

9. ALB is used to distribute web traffic across an ASG of EC2 instances in multiple AZS.

10. Using ASG to dynamically create our EC2 instances to make our website highly available scable, fault tolerance, and elastic

11. We are using Route53 to register our domain name and create a record set. 

12. We are using AWS S3 to store our Webfiles.

13. We will use IAM Role to give EC2 permission to download Webfiles from AWS S3.

14. Once we have installed our website on an EC2 instance, we will use the EC2 instance we installed our website on to create an AMI
